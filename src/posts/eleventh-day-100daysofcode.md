I finally wrote something to the about page, so I had this Idea to show graphically part of my life, so I think a good start was to make this verticalTimeline component, to start to write down this ideas, I think the website is almost complete, but I want to pulish a bit and launch in the next days.

The component was really easy to made using tailwindcss.
