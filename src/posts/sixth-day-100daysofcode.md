Today I made a cards component to visualize the last 3 post in the home view, it's not perfect right now but I hope to improve it with the days.

I made use of StaticQuery for the first time, and it was nice to have the experience. 

I think is the day where I am more tired, so was difficult to be concentrate, let's see tomorrow that is saturday to make a better progress.

Let's keep coding.
