In my continue try to give to the blog section a look and feel like a *real blog* I worked today on use some tailwind classes to add style to the single post template.

I'm not 100% convinced of the results but I think is a good start point, I am also thinking on the palette of colors that I want to use, and of course planning to work in the other sections.

Maybe I need to spend more than one hour some day, because I really want to have it done and continue the challenge with other kind of projects.

Let's keep coding.
