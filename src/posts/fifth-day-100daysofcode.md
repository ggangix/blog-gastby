Well on this day after I failed to upgrade to the new tailwind version (2.0) that they release yesterday, I wanted to do something productive, so I added a new field to every post, this field is called tags and it will be used for the component SEO to create the meta keywords to every page.

Also I made some personalizations in the colors of the site, still not sure about the palette.

Let's keep coding.
