To start the second day I wanted to have a complete route to access to every post. So, I read a little bit about how to do it and was more easy that I thought. 

**Summary of my day:**

- Created dinamically one route for every markdown file. With user friendly urls defined by the filename.
- Created single post template.
- Added a link to the blog in the header.
- Changed the names of the first two post (not sure yet about it).
- Wrote down this post.

For tomorrow I would like to integrate the blog and single post with the rest of the site, and style is still pending.
