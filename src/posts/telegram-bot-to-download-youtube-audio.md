I finished the first stable version of my Telegram Bot to download youtube videos, convert to audio and send it back, for now it's really simple just made the function, but I am quite happy with the result in the short time.

You can see the source code here: https://github.com/ggangix/Youtube-to-Audio-Telegram-Bot.git

## Usage

1. Install youtube-dl
2. Clone the repository
3. npm install
4. Add an .env file with the following structure:

```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=

```
