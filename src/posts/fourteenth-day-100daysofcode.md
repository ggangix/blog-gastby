Today the first day after  my blog is online, I noticed some visualizations issues when you try to access to the website from a mobile phone, so I spend the last hour fixing thoses problems, and now looks better.

I also changed the format of the dates because I would like to show something like "2020-11-26" rather than "2 days ago", I don't know, just personal preferences ðŸ˜‰

So I would try to do something else tomorrow, and bring the fun to the roof.
