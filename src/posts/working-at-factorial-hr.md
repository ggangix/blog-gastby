Well as some of you know from my last post, [I moved from Germany to Barcelona.][1], after started to work at [Factorial HR][2].

## The hiring process

1. **Call with the Manager and Technical Lead:** Talk about the company and the culture and the job you want to do. 

It was great to know that was exactly what I was looking for, something in Spain and opportunity to learn and grow.
  
2. **Code Assignment:** They give you some requeriments and 8 hours to solve a full stack code challenge. You can do it in any language you want, but you have to be able to explain your code to the reviewers.
 
It was really challenging to do it while I was working fulltime in another company, I didn't have the energy at night but I was so motivated because I read and listened a lot of nice things about the company.  
  
Technical note: I implemented the solution using Ruby on Rails and React.js with Material-UI.

3. **Code Review:** Basically, you have to explain your code and your technical decisions to other devs (3 in my case).

This step was good for me because I could see how is the feedback with technical people in the company, and I was 100% sure that I want to join the team, I was looking for this kind of *positive mentoring*.

4. **Offer**: They give you a job offer and some other details about the onboarding.

I was so confident before the call that I was going to join the team that I went out the day before and ran 21km to say good bye to my old city. 

After talk with my wife, **I accepted** ðŸ¥³.

## My experience after 3 months

The work enviroment is exactly was I was looking for, a good place to keep growing, with a lot of great devs very open to talk with you and to share their experience.

Another point that I want to highlight is the way how they try to challenge you to learn from your weaknesses and to improve your skills day by day. 

They slogan of the company is: "Bet on people" and they do it very well. They offer you some extra benefits (lifestyle and educational opportunities). And in my case, they helped me in the migration process.

We (wife & me) are very happy with the decision we took, after some months with a lot of tasks to do, we can say we love Barcelona as much as we dreamed, and just have to say thanks to Factorial to make it possible.
