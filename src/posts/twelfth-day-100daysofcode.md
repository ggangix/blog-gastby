Today I made the Privacy Policy page and also wrote down some paragraph more to the about page. I think is enought for now, and I can publish the blog tomorrow on my 13th day of the challenge, It is very special to me because tomorrow it's Friday and ðŸ˜± the 13th! ðŸ˜±.

I am sure that I can improve the visualization and the content but this is the point of the challenge to be active and keep doing things day by day.

Let's DO IT!
