Yesterday I made an implementation on my [Telegram bot][1] to set a limit of duration to the files to convert, but I am not 100% happy, I would like to implement something to split audio, my first idea is doing it just on special cases and using ffmpeg. 

For today I started this implementation and I hope to finish it in the nex days.

Happy coding.
