The beggining was not easy, as is obvious the language was the most difficult part, not be able to fully communicate it was something that we knew that would happen but it's more complicated when you live this kind of situations day by day.</p>\n<h3>Finding a job</h3>\n<p>I started to look for a job using linkedin, and angellist, applying for a lot of different offers, but without having too much luck. One day I decided to search in twitter for the keywords \"developer kiel\" (the city where I was living) and voila, I apply for the first result, a TV Company (Foxxum) \"why they need a developer to sell TVs? maybe for the website?\" was the first thing that came to my mind in that moment.</p>\n<p>They reply almost inmmidiately and we book an interview that week, I met the Engineering Manager (for this moment only 3 devs more in the company, just 1 full time), and from that moment I felt connected to the company, small in that time.</p>\n<p>After 2 test days, they make me an offer to start the following week, and of course I said yes.</p>\n<h3>Working at Foxxum</h3>\n<p>I started in 2016 to develop apps for Smart TVs, working at Foxxum GmbH, this give me and improve my developer skills, and make me met incredible persons, dozens of coworkers and friends. I know I'll miss this office forever, a really nice and quiet place to work.</p>\n<p>I liked to solve problems in TV Apps and also to innovate with some solutions, using mostly Javascript and PHP, and of course loving each challenge.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everybody in Foxxum. I love you all!</p>\n<h3>The big choise to moving out</h3>\n<p>After almost 5 years working and living in Germany, we (me and my wife) have a conversation one day that we were not fully happy in Germany and in our current jobs, for different reasons, and we wanted to explore and maybe accomplish one of our life goals, to live in a big city at least for some months/years, we found that was the perfect moment to us to do that, and we needed new challenges. </p>\n<p>One week after that conversation I had one interview with a Barcelona company that got my attention, two weeks after that I got the offer, and 2 months after that I started to work with them and... </p>\n<h3>3 months after that: WE ARE IN BARCELONA!</h3>\n<p>Finally we are here, nothing was easy in the move, left a really good job, a lovely place, my family there, MY NEPHEW, and a lot of good friends... But we had too much luck to find a flat to live almost inmmidiately, after my good friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juanpi_dev\">Juan Pablo</a> hosted us at his cozy flat for some days.</p>\n<h3>What about the new company?</h3>\n<p>Next Blog post.</p>\n<h5>100 days of code challenge?</h5>\n<p>If some of you are asking, \"why this guy stop the 100 days of code challenge\" ? Well, I have to retake it some day but first I wanted to write some updates about my life.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2021-08-08 - 14:47","title":"Life Update - The German Chapter... ends?","tags":"life, developer, germany, giuseppe, gangi","author":"Giuseppe Gangi"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life-update-the-german-chapter/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
