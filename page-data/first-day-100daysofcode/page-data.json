But I would like to learn and use Gatsby.js and Tailwind CSS because the last weeks I saw some videos and websites and looks really nice.</p>\n<h2>Installing Gatsby Tailwind Starter</h2>\n<p>There is a Gatbsy+Tailwind starter repository, so I cloned it to be the base of this blog you are reading :D </p>\n<pre><code>gatsby new blog https://github.com/taylorbryant/gatsby-starter-tailwind\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, we can run it </p>\n<pre><code>cd blog\nnpm run develop\n</code></pre>\n<p>After that I took a quick look about the structure and use, and create the folder posts/ and wrote down this <strong>colossal</strong> text to the first post.</p>\n<h2>Installing gatsby-source-filesystem and gatsby-transformer-remark</h2>\n<p>Ok we have the first post, but where is the blog? well we need to install <strong>gatsby-source-filesystem</strong> to be able to take local system data to the Gatsby app and <strong>gatsby-transformer-remark</strong> to transform markdown files to HTML.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install gatsby-source-filesystem\nnpm install gatsby-transformer-remark\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then I added this to the configuration to source the posts folder</p>\n<pre><code>    {\n      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,\n      options: {\n        name: `posts`,\n        path: `${__dirname}/src/posts/`,\n      },\n    },\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Create a blog page</h2>\n<p>I made a blog page iterating the markdown files in the posts folder, for now without any style or something just for test.</p>\n<h2>Github</h2>\n<p>I am done for today, so I created a github repo and push this code, this will be good for push me up to keep doing the challenge.</p>\n<h2>For the next days</h2>\n<p>Ok, this first day was nice, but I think didn't enjoy too much to write down all the things I made (what is a blog? :P), so I think for the next days I'll list the task after finish them but not too much in details unless I noticed something insteresting.</p>\n<h2>Hit me up!</h2>\n<p>Please let me know if you read this some day, just a +1 could be great to my motivation :D (Yes, everything is about me)</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"12 days ago","title":"1/100 days of code - Creating a blog with Gatsby and Tailwind","tags":"100daysofcode, giuseppe, gangi, gatsby, tailwind, javascript","author":"Giuseppe Gangi"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/first-day-100daysofcode/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
