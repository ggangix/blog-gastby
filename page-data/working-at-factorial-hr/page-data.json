You can do it in any language you want, but you have to be able to explain your code to the reviewers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It was really challenging to do it while I was working fulltime in another company, I didn't have the energy at night but I was so motivated because I read and listened a lot of nice things about the company.  </p>\n<p>Technical note: I implemented the solution using Ruby on Rails and React.js with Material-UI.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Code Review:</strong> Basically, you have to explain your code and your technical decisions to other devs (3 in my case).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This step was good for me because I could see how is the feedback with technical people in the company, and I was 100% sure that I want to join the team, I was looking for this kind of <em>positive mentoring</em>.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Offer</strong>: They give you a job offer and some other details about the onboarding.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was so confident before the call that I was going to join the team that I went out the day before and ran 21km to say good bye to my old city. </p>\n<p>After talk with my wife, <strong>I accepted</strong> ðŸ¥³.</p>\n<h2>My experience after 3 months</h2>\n<p>The work enviroment is exactly was I was looking for, a good place to keep growing, with a lot of great devs very open to talk with you and to share their experience.</p>\n<p>Another point that I want to highlight is the way how they try to challenge you to learn from your weaknesses and to improve your skills day by day. </p>\n<p>They slogan of the company is: \"Bet on people\" and they do it very well. They offer you some extra benefits (lifestyle and educational opportunities). And in my case, they helped me in the migration process.</p>\n<p>We (wife &#x26; me) are very happy with the decision we took, after some months with a lot of tasks to do, we can say we love Barcelona as much as we dreamed, and just have to say thanks to Factorial to make it possible.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2021-09-30 - 20:00","title":"Working at Factorial HR as a Software Engineer","tags":"life, developer, factorial hr, giuseppe, gangi, software, engineer,","author":"Giuseppe Gangi"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/working-at-factorial-hr/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
